Check out the "Documentation" folder and open the "LaserMaze.html" file in your browser for a better understanding of what we've accomplished in this project and how. We've provided detailed circuit diagram and pin diagrams as well. 

We used Atmel Studio 7.0 to code for this project. The source codes for the three ATmega32s we've used are in three different folders - GameController, GameObject and BluetoothReceiver. Check out the .atsln project file in each folder.
